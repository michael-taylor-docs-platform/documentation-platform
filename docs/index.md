## Documentation Systems & Platform Engineering

This portfolio highlights documentation engineering systems, automation workflows, and governance architectures built for enterprise-scale publishing environments.

The work demonstrates how documentation can be engineered as deterministic, release-critical infrastructure.

---

## Core Capabilities Demonstrated

- Deterministic documentation platform architecture
- DITA + Markdown transformation pipelines
- PR-gated validation workflows (GitHub Actions)
- Cross-reference integrity automation
- Author-enablement tooling
- Environment-aware publishing controls
- Enterprise governance separation
- Manual promotion workflows for production safety
- Enhancement of legacy pipelines without system disruption

---

## AI-Assisted Engineering Approach

All projects showcased on this site were architected and implemented using a human-directed, AI-assisted engineering methodology.

AI was used as:

- A structured development accelerator
- A design refinement partner
- A validation and edge-case exploration tool
- A documentation synthesis assistant

System architecture, validation logic, governance patterns, and workflow integration were human-directed and architected with deterministic intent.

The result demonstrates how AI can be responsibly integrated into enterprise documentation engineering workflows without sacrificing structural rigor, maintainability, or operational control.

## Architectural Philosophy

Source → Transformation → Validation → Promotion → Publish

Documentation is engineered as a system.

It is:

- Deterministic
- CI/CD-integrated
- Governance-aware
- Author-friendly
- Environment-controlled

Each section of this site contains standalone examples of workflows and scripts developed to improve reliability, reduce manual correction, and strengthen documentation as an operational platform.
